# Image So Sweet

> A professional photography website built in React JSX for the front end. The backend was built with Flask SqlAlchemy and Python for my API. This is a website that will be actively used by customers. It is currently on version 1. Future versions will include a client management tool, a password protected admin page to control site content using CRUD options and manage clients. A schedule that shows what days are available for booking.
